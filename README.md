# Iot Firmware
Here you'll find various IoT application reference design firmware binaries designed to run on ARM Cortex-M MCU development platforms.

Our IoT application firmware binaries utilize our firmware deployment technology and are intended for eventual commercialization and production.

With our firmware binaries you can get your prototype up and running fast yet still be in a position to take the next step towards commercialization.
